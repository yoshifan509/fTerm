# About

fTerm is a terminal with english syntax and natural language processing.

# How-To

To run *command* with arguments *a1, a2,...*, simply run

```
f command a1, a2,...
```

The fTerm interpreter will then attempt to interpret *command*.
First it will check if it was defined as a synonym of another, defined, command, and then do a string-based (typo-preventing) search. It will then prompt you with

```
[f-i] interpreted_command a1, a2...
```

If you enter anything (except just pressing the return key), the command will not be run.

## Examples

```
$ f list
[f-i] list⏎
a.txt
b.rst
c.mp4
$ f remove b.rst
[f-i] delete a⏎
$ f list
[f-i] list⏎
a.txt
c.mp4
```

```
$ f read a
[f-i] read a⏎
this is a test!
$ f read b
[f-i] read b⏎
this is also a test!
$ f swap a b
[f-i] swap a b⏎
[f] Swapped a and b
$ cat a
this is also a test!
$ cat b
this is a test!
```
